## Today I Learned

***This project is a work-in-progress.***

A simple Next.js app to help me keep track of my notes (programming-related). 
An alternative to messaging to myself in Slack :sweat_smile:

This app is a Next.js port of this [repository](https://github.com/alexnguyenn/today-i-learned). 
Deployed to Vercel. Bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Main tools used:
* [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/): GraphQL Content API for my notes. Very quick and easy to set up. 
* [Apollo Cilent](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/): For working with GraphQL. 
* [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown): For rendering markdown content within React.
